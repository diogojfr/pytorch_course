**What deep learning is good for**:
- problems with long lists of rules 
- continually changing enviroment (DL can adaot to new scenarios)
- discovering insights within large collections of data
<br>
<br>

**What deep learning is typically not good for**:
- when you need explainability (patterns learned by a DL model are typically uninterpretable by a human) 
- when traditional approach is a better option (if you can acomplish what you need with a simple rule-based system)
- when errors are unacceptable (DL model outputs aren't always predictable)
- when you don't have much data

**Neural Networks (NN)**

Example
1. Inputs (iamges, text. audios)
2. Numerical encoding (before data gets used witha NN, it needs to be turned into numbers)
3. Learns representation (patterns/features/weights. Each node is a hidden unit or a neuron)
4. Representation outputs (numerical representations for the output data)
5. Output (data in a way human can understand)

Types of learning
- supervised
- unsupervised and self-supervised
- transfer learning (when the patterns learned from a model are transfered to another model)
